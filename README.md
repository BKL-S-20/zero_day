**Getting closer to my goa; being a software engineer**
#This is my first project using vagrant (What are my feelings?)
1. I'm feeling lost and thrilled
2. I don't know what I'm supposed to write in this file so I'm expressing myself
*Ok serious talk*
#This project is all about me figuring out how to work with vagrant and know more about VM
**It was a fun experience**
